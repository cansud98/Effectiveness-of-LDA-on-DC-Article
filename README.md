#### Key Points:  
* Lightning data assimilation was applied in the KF and KF-CuP convective parameterizations in WRF-Chem.
*	A novel version of lightning data assimilation improves the representation of convective storms, particularly for rainfall intensity and location accuracy.
*	LDA simulation improves cloud top height yet continues to underestimate the tallest clouds and rainfall in the MCS case, while overestimating in the supercell.

#### Abstract  
Deep convection greatly influences the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) by rapidly transporting aerosols and chemical species from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the UTLS. This transport affects air quality and atmospheric chemistry and has potential implications for weather and climate. Therefore, accurate simulation is essential for a comprehensive understanding. Two observed cases of deep convection are simulated: An Oklahoma supercell on 29 May 2012 and a mesoscale convective system (MCS) on 11 June 2012, both occurring during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign. We employ the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and apply established parameterizations for convection and transport. To enhance the accuracy of the simulated deep convective clouds in terms of timing, location, and depth, we use a novel lightning data assimilation (LDA) scheme. The simulations are compared with observations and with a WRF-Chem simulation without LDA. The advantages and limitations of the LDA scheme are evaluated in terms of basic meteorological parameters, simulated precipitation, and cloud top heights. Object-based verification and traditional statistical (grid-to-grid) techniques are utilized. Findings indicate that the LDA technique produces considerably better results than simulations without LDA. Statistical metrics of convective rainfall in both the supercell and MCS cases are improved greatly. LDA also provides more accurate cloud top heights for the supercell case but exhibits relatively less success in terms of areal cloud coverage for the MCS case. The LDA simulations produce taller cloud top heights and more precipitation in the supercell case, but conversely in the MCS case.
